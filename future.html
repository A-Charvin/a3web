									<h2>The Future in our view</h2>
									<p> 
										All things considered, the future of GIS is very optimistic. It is poised for even wider scale adoption than we have seen in recent decades, as more organizations learn how much business value can come from geospatial data. As trends like data analytics, mobility, AR, and IoT continue to take off around the world, we can expect geographic information science and technology not only to be transformed but also to help change the way organizations utilize these technologies.

									<h2>AI and GIS</h2>
									<p>In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced rapidly, equal or even surpassing human accuracy in tasks such as image recognition, reading comprehension, and text translation. In broad terms, AI refers to a computerâ€™s capacity to accomplish a task that normally needs some level of human intellect. Machine learning is one type of engine that makes this possible. It learns from data using data-driven algorithms to provide you with the answers you require. Deep learning is a new type of machine learning that uses computer-generated neural networks that are inspired by and resemble the human brain to solve problems and make predictions. The convergence of AI and GIS is opening up previously unimaginable possibilities. AI GIS is a phrase that refers to a group of technologies that combine artificial intelligence (AI) with GIS operations such as spatial data processing and analysis algorithms (GeoAI). AI GIS has progressively been the major focus of geoscience research and application in recent years.</p>

									<h2>The Integration of man and machine</h2>
									<p>GeoAI is a spatial data processing and analysis algorithm that integrates AI. GeoAI is divided into two parts: geospatial machine learning and geospatial deep learning. Using Geospatial Machine Learning in ArcGIS, users may tackle a number of GIS application challenges such as geographical clustering, spatial classification, and spatial regression. The Geospatial Deep Learning algorithms in ArcGIS, for example,</p>

										<ul><li> 3D data analysis and image analysis. AI for GIS on the other hand refers to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the intelligence of GIS software, such as AI attribute collection, AI survey and mapping, AI cartography, and AI interaction.</li>
										
										<li>The most competitive firms are investing strategically in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, and using location data as a connecting thread to automate processes, improve predictive.</li></ul>
										
										As a growing GIS firm we are into Research and Development phase and soon launch our product which integrates Artificial Intelligence with GIS.
